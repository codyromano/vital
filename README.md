# DataBass

**Note**: *vital* was this app's working title. By the time I switched to *DataBass*, there were enough build hooks, etc., that changing the repo name was too time consuming.

## About this app

DataBass increases the intensity of your workout playlist as you run faster (using GPS and realtime audio filtering). This package is for the client-side (React, Webpack assets) portion.
